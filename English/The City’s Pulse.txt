## Theme: Urban Life and Humanity

Neon veins across the street,
Pulsing with the restless beat.
Voices clash and dreams collide,
In towers tall where hopes reside.

Iron hearts in suits of grey,
Chasing light that fades away.
Footsteps echo, brief, confined,
In concrete prayers of humankind.

Beneath the steel, a river flows,
Of quiet thoughts no stranger knows.
A mother hums to soothe her child,
A poet writes where chaos smiled.

The night consumes the city’s flame,
Yet dawn repeats the endless game.
The skyline breathes; it never sleeps,
Its promise vast, its secret deep.

We build, we break, we love, we mend—
In motion still, till journey’s end.
And every soul that walks this maze,
Adds one more spark to urban blaze.
