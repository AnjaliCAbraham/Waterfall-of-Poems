## Theme: Grief and Healing

The world stood still, the wind forgot,
To move the leaves where sorrow caught.
A whisper lingered, soft, undone,
Between the dusk and rising sun.

No words could fill the hollow air,
No hand could ease the weight of care.
Yet silence spoke in steady tone,
“You’re not forgotten, not alone.”

The tears that fell were seeds unseen,
They watered hope, made sorrow lean.
And from that grief, a garden grew,
Of strength reborn, of hearts made new.

For loss does not mean love’s release,
It turns to light, to quiet peace.
The echo stays, though time moves fast,
A gentle link to what has passed.

And so I stand, the night grown mild,
Remembering pain, yet reconciled.
For silence taught what words could not—
That endings fade, but love does not.
