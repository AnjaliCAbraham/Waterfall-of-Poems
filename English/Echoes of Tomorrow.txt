## Theme: Hope and Time

The clock hums softly in the hall,
Each tick a whisper, faint, yet tall.
The night unrolls its sable sheet,
Where dreams and doubts in silence meet.

The stars like lanterns guard the way,
Guiding hearts that fear to stray.
Through shadows deep and mornings pale,
Hope weaves its own eternal tale.

The seed once buried learns to grow,
Through frost and storm, through fire and snow.
The years may steal what hands have made,
But never dim what hearts have laid.

The future hums beneath the ground,
A rhythm waiting to be found.
So walk with faith, though sight is dim,
Each loss refines the soul within.

And when the dawn begins to rise,
You’ll find the truth in weary eyes—
That time, though cruel, can also mend,
And every fall births flight again.
