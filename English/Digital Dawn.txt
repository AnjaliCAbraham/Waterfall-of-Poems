## Theme: Technology and the Future of Humanity

Circuits hum like morning bees,
Data drifts on coded seas.
In silver shells, the world replays,
A million lives, a billion ways.

We speak in light, we dream in code,
Through endless clouds, our thoughts unload.
The stars now burn on wired lines,
Our cosmos born of new designs.

Yet somewhere deep in electric veins,
The human pulse still soft remains.
A heartbeat lost in binary,
Still hums with ancient memory.

Will steel recall the warmth of clay?
Will thought outlive the breathâ€™s decay?
Perhaps our ghosts will roam the screen,
And whisper truth through endless green.

Progress hums its lullaby,
Machines evolve, and so do I.
For in this dawn of silicon grace,
We seek the soul within the interface.
